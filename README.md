# Dungeons and Dragons RL Combat Simulator
Project for CS5446 AI Planning and Decision Making Semester 1 AY22/23 at NUS SoC

This application project focuses on decision making with Reinforcement learning in discrete action multi process scenarios in games. Specifically on an environment simulator and machine learning models for 1v1 combat scenarios in the game Dungeons and Dragons (referred to as D&D from here on). 3 unique classes(Barbarian, Ranger, Wizard) are implemented at level 3, with simplified versions of their abilities added as available actions.
